## Usage

This action builds and uploads Rust binary that specified by `bin` option to
GitHub Releases.

Currently, this action is basically intended to be used in combination with an action like [create-gh-release-action] that creates a GitHub release when a tag is pushed. See also [supported events](#supported-events).

### Example workflow: Basic usage

In this example, when a new tag is pushed, creating a new GitHub Release by
using [create-gh-release-action], then uploading Rust binary to the created
GitHub Release.

An archive file with a name like `$bin-$target.tar.gz` will be uploaded to
GitHub Release.

```yaml
name: Release

permissions:
  contents: write

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.*

jobs:
  create-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: taiki-e/create-gh-release-action@v1
        with:
          # (optional) Path to changelog.
          changelog: CHANGELOG.md
          # (required) GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  upload-assets:
    needs: create-release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
        with:
          # (required) Comma-separated list of binary names (non-extension portion of filename) to build and upload.
          # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
          bin: ...
          # (required) GitHub token for uploading assets to GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

You can specify multiple binaries when the root manifest is a virtual manifest or specified binaries are in the same crate.

```yaml
- uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
  with:
    # (required) Comma-separated list of binary names (non-extension portion of filename) to build and upload.
    # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
    bin: app1,app2
    # (optional) Archive name (non-extension portion of filename) to be uploaded.
    # [default value: $bin-$target]
    # [possible values: the following variables and any string]
    #   variables:
    #     - $bin    - Binary name (non-extension portion of filename).
    #     - $target - Target triple.
    #     - $tag    - Tag of this release.
    # When multiple binary names are specified, default archive name or $bin variable cannot be used.
    archive: app-$target
    # (required) GitHub token for uploading assets to GitHub Releases.
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Example workflow: Basic usage (multiple platforms)

This action supports Linux, macOS, and Windows as a host OS and supports
binaries for various targets.

See also [cross-compilation example](#example-workflow-cross-compilation).

```yaml
name: Release

permissions:
  contents: write

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.*

        with:
          # (optional) Path to changelog.
          changelog: CHANGELOG.md
          # (required) GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  upload-assets:
    needs: create-release
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
            os: ubuntu-latest
          - target: x86_64-apple-darwin
            os: macos-latest
          - target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
            os: windows-latest
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
        with:
          # (required) Comma-separated list of binary names (non-extension portion of filename) to build and upload.
          # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
          bin: ...
          # (optional) Target triple, default is host triple.
          # This is optional but it is recommended that this always be set to
          # clarify which target you are building for if macOS is included in
          # the matrix because GitHub Actions changed the default architecture
          # of macos-latest since macos-14.
          target: ${{ matrix.target }}
          # (optional) On which platform to distribute the `.tar.gz` file.
          # [default value: unix]
          # [possible values: all, unix, windows, none]
          tar: unix
          # (optional) On which platform to distribute the `.zip` file.
          # [default value: windows]
          # [possible values: all, unix, windows, none]
          zip: windows
          # (required) GitHub token for uploading assets to GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Example workflow: Customize archive name

By default, this action will upload an archive file with a name like
`$bin-$target.$extension`.

You can customize archive name by `archive` option.

```yaml
name: Release

permissions:
  contents: write

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.*

jobs:
  create-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: taiki-e/create-gh-release-action@v1
        with:
          # (optional) Path to changelog.
          changelog: CHANGELOG.md
          # (required) GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  upload-assets:
    needs: create-release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
        with:
          bin: ...
          # (optional) Archive name (non-extension portion of filename) to be uploaded.
          # [default value: $bin-$target]
          # [possible values: the following variables and any string]
          #   variables:
          #     - $bin    - Binary name (non-extension portion of filename).
          #     - $target - Target triple.
          #     - $tag    - Tag of this release.
          # When multiple binary names are specified, default archive name or $bin variable cannot be used.
          archive: $bin-$tag-$target
          # (required) GitHub token for uploading assets to GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Example workflow: Build with different features on different platforms

This action enables the `systemd` and `io_uring` features for Linux, and leave macOS, and Windows with default set of features.

```yaml
name: Release

permissions:
  contents: write

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.*

jobs:
  create-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - uses: taiki-e/create-gh-release-action@v1
        with:
          # (optional) Path to changelog.
          changelog: CHANGELOG.md
          # (required) GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  upload-assets:
    needs: create-release
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
            os: ubuntu-latest
            features: systemd,io_uring
          - target: x86_64-apple-darwin
            os: macos-latest
          - target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
            os: windows-latest
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
        with:
          # (required) Comma-separated list of binary names (non-extension portion of filename) to build and upload.
          # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
          bin: ...
          # (optional) Target triple, default is host triple.
          target: ${{ matrix.target }}
          # (optional) On which platform to distribute the `.tar.gz` file.
          # [default value: unix]
          # [possible values: all, unix, windows, none]
          tar: unix
          # (optional) On which platform to distribute the `.zip` file.
          # [default value: windows]
          # [possible values: all, unix, windows, none]
          zip: windows
          # (optional) Build with the given set of features if any.
          features: ${{ matrix.features || '' }}
          # (required) GitHub token for uploading assets to GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Example workflow: Cross-compilation

#### cross

By default, this action uses [cross] for cross-compilation (if cross supports that target). In the following example, only aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu uses cross, the rest use cargo.

If cross is not installed, this action calls `cargo install cross --locked` to install cross. If you want to speed up the installation of cross or use an older version of cross, consider using [install-action].

```yaml
name: Release

permissions:
  contents: write

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.*

jobs:
  create-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: taiki-e/create-gh-release-action@v1
        with:
          # (optional) Path to changelog.
          changelog: CHANGELOG.md
          # (required) GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  upload-assets:
    needs: create-release
    strategy:

        include:
          - target: aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
            os: ubuntu-latest
          - target: aarch64-apple-darwin
            os: macos-latest
          - target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
            os: ubuntu-latest
          - target: x86_64-apple-darwin
            os: macos-latest
          # Universal macOS binary is supported as universal-apple-darwin.
          - target: universal-apple-darwin
            os: macos-latest
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
        with:
          # (required) Comma-separated list of binary names (non-extension portion of filename) to build and upload.
          # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
          bin: ...
          # (optional) Target triple, default is host triple.
          target: ${{ matrix.target }}
          # (required) GitHub token for uploading assets to GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

#### setup-cross-toolchain-action

However, if the host has another cross-compilation setup, it will be respected.
The following is an example using [setup-cross-toolchain-action]. In this example, this action uses cargo for all targets.

```yaml
name: Release

        if: startsWith(matrix.os, 'ubuntu')
      - uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
        with:
          # (required) Comma-separated list of binary names (non-extension portion of filename) to build and upload.

          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

#### cargo-zigbuild

if you want to use [cargo-zigbuild], if the heuristic to detect host cross-compilation setups does not work well, or if you want to force the use of cargo or cross, you can use the `build-tool` input option.

If cargo-zigbuild is not installed, this action calls `pip3 install cargo-zigbuild` to install cargo-zigbuild.

      - uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
        with:
          # (required)
          bin: ...

```

### Example workflow: Include additional files

If you want include additional file *to the archive*, you can use the `include` option.

```yaml
name: Release

permissions:
  contents: write

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.*

jobs:
  create-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: taiki-e/create-gh-release-action@v1
        with:
          # (optional) Path to changelog.
          changelog: CHANGELOG.md
          # (required) GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  upload-assets:
    needs: create-release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
        with:
          # (required) Comma-separated list of binary names (non-extension portion of filename) to build and upload.
          # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
          bin: ...
          # (optional) Comma-separated list of additional files to be included to archive.
          # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
          include: LICENSE,README.md
          # (required) GitHub token for uploading assets to GitHub Releases.
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

By default, the expanded archive does not include the leading directory. In the above example, the directory structure of the archive would be as follows:

```text
/<bin>
/LICENSE
/README.md
```

You can use the `leading-dir` option to create the leading directory.

```yaml
- uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
  with:
    # (required) Comma-separated list of binary names (non-extension portion of filename) to build and upload.
    # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
    bin: ...
    # (optional) Comma-separated list of additional files to be included to archive.
    # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
    include: LICENSE,README.md
    # (optional) Whether to create the leading directory in the archive or not. default to false.
    leading-dir: true
    # (required) GitHub token for uploading assets to GitHub Releases.
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

In the above example, the directory structure of the archive would be as follows:

```text
/<archive>/
/<archive>/<bin>
/<archive>/LICENSE
/<archive>/README.md
```

You can use the `bin-leading-dir` option to create extra leading directory(s) for binary file(s) specified by `bin` option.

```yaml
- uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
  with:
    # (required) Comma-separated list of binary names (non-extension portion of filename) to build and upload.
    # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
    bin: ...
    # (optional) Comma-separated list of additional files to be included to archive.
    # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
    include: LICENSE,README.md
    # (optional) Whether to create the leading directory in the archive or not. default to false.
    leading-dir: true
    # (optional) Create extra leading directory(s) for binary file(s) specified by `bin` option. default to empty.
    bin-leading-dir: opt/leading
    # (required) GitHub token for uploading assets to GitHub Releases.
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

In the above example, the directory structure of the archive would be as follows:

```text
/<archive>/
/<archive>/opt/leading/<bin>
/<archive>/LICENSE
/<archive>/README.md
```

If you want upload additional file *separately*, you can use the `asset` option.

```yaml
upload-assets:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1
      with:
        # (required) Comma-separated list of binary names (non-extension portion of filename) to build and upload.
        # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
        bin: ...
        # (optional) Comma-separated list of additional files to be uploaded separately.
        # Note that glob pattern is not supported yet.
        asset: LICENSE,README.md
        # (required) GitHub token for uploading assets to GitHub Releases.
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

In the above example, the following 3 files will be uploaded:

```text
<bin>-<target>.tar.gz
LICENSE
README.md
```

### Optimize Rust binary

You can optimize performance or size of Rust binaries by passing the profile options.
The profile options can be specified by [`[profile]` table in `Cargo.toml`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html), [cargo config](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html), [environment variables](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#configuration-environment-variables), etc.

The followings are examples to specify profile options:

- [lto](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#lto)

  With profile:

  ```toml
  [profile.release]
  lto = true
  ```

  With environment variable:

  ```yaml
  env:
    CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO: true
  ```

- [codegen-units](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#codegen-units)

  With profile:

  ```toml
  [profile.release]
  codegen-units = 1
  ```

  With environment variable:

  ```yaml
  env:
    CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_CODEGEN_UNITS: 1
  ```

- [strip](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#strip)

  With profile:

  ```toml
  [profile.release]
  strip = "symbols"
  ```

  [Default is `strip = debuginfo`.](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13257)

**Note:** Some of these options may increase the build time.

## Supported events

The following two events are supported by default:

- tags ([`on.push.tags`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#push))

  For example:

  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      tags:
        - v[0-9]+.*
  ```

- GitHub release ([`on.release`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#release))

  For example:

  ```yaml
  on:
    release:
      types: [created]
  ```

You can upload binaries from arbitrary event to arbitrary tag by specifying the `ref` input option.

For example, to upload binaries to the `my_tag` tag, specify `ref` input option as follows:

```yaml
with:
  ref: refs/tags/my_tag
```
